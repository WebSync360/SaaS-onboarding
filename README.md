# ONBOARDING MVP — TURN NEW USERS INTO ACTIVATED USERS

---

# WHY THIS EXISTS

---

Most early-stage products don’t fail because of features.
They fail because users don’t understand what to do next.

This project is a REAL onboarding MVP designed to help founders:
• Guide users step-by-step
• Capture meaningful onboarding actions
• See what users complete (and where they drop off)
• Decide what to build next with confidence

This is not a mockup.
Not a Figma screen.
It is a working product layer.

---

# THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES

---

Founders often ask:

• “Are users completing onboarding?”

• “Where are they getting stuck?”

• “Is this worth investing more time into?”

This MVP answers those questions early,
before overbuilding or wasting resources.

---

# WHAT THIS MVP DELIVERS (FOUNDER VIEW)

---

✔ A clear, guided onboarding flow

✔ Real user actions (not placeholders)

✔ A response / admin dashboard

✔ Visibility into onboarding progress

✔ A foundation that can grow with the product

---

# HOW IT WORKS (SIMPLE FLOW)

---
User signs up

→ Guided onboarding steps

→ Actions are captured

→ Founder views responses in a dashboard

Simple by design.

---

# WHAT’S INCLUDED IN THIS MVP LAYER

---

• Clean onboarding experience

• Backend-connected responses

• Response / admin dashboard

• Product-ready structure

• Deployed and usable


Built to answer:
“Is this working?”
before asking:
“How do we scale this?”

---

# PRODUCT THINKING BEHIND IT

---

This MVP was built with these principles:

• Validate before scaling

• Build the smallest real thing

• Optimize for learning, not perfection

• Avoid dead-end prototypes

Every part exists to help a founder make a decision.

---

# WHO THIS IS FOR

---

• Early-stage SaaS founders

• Solo founders testing ideas

• Teams pre-investment or pre-scale

• Anyone who needs real user signals fast

---

# WHAT THIS IS NOT (BY DESIGN)

---

• Not over-engineered

• Not feature-heavy

• Not locked into one direction

This is a starting point,
not the final product.

---

# WHAT CAN BE ADDED NEXT (IF VALIDATION IS POSITIVE)

---

• Auth & roles

• Analytics

• Email / notifications

• Feature flags

• Deeper dashboards

• Integrations


Nothing here blocks future growth.

---

# WHY THIS MATTERS

---

Founders don’t need more code.
They need clarity.

This onboarding MVP provides:

• Clear user signals

• Confidence to move forward

• A real product to show users or investors
